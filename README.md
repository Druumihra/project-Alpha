# project-Alpha

Just a personal project which I intend to work on whenever I feel like it. 

Intending to create a rogue-like of some kind with procedural generation and hopefully fun gameplay loop

Visual are intended to be pixel art.


## Theme: Medieval Europe

## Gameplay loop


## Classes
Possibility of subclasses????  
### Knight: Basic melee class 
### Mage:
### Sorcerer:
### Cleric: holy powers, (healer subclass if multiplayer?)
### Cavalry:
### Archer:
### King: Multi character class?
### Assassin:
### Necromancer: 
Possibilty 1: Has built in slot system where it gets more slots with lvl/upgrades. It can then reanimate dead corpses for a cost of slots which will fight for him and are slightly stronger than enemy counterparts
Possibility 2: Can find dead heroes around the level which he can reanimate. Dead characters from older runs?
