## project-Alpha

Just a personal project which I intend to work on whenever I feel like it. 

Intending to create a rogue-like of some kind with procedural generation and hopefully fun gameplay loop

Visual are intended to be pixel art.


# Theme: Medieval Europe

# Gameplay loop:


# Classes:
Knight:
Mage:
Sorcerer:
Cleric:
Cavalry:
Archer:
King:
Assassin:
Necromancer:


# Player Stats:
HP
Movespeed
Mana
Defense
Attack speed
Amount
Curse

idea:
Player stat for the necro like Spirit. This stat makes his summons stronger
Luck stat for finding rare items

# Enemies


# Upgrades
## idea:
### HP, Mana, Attack speed, movement speed, piercing for ranged, Spirit (for the Necro and King, if you add this), Defence, Luck (a stat that boosts chance for finding rare items), Upgrade to keep your currency when you die, Revive?, Magic dmg, Physical dmg, More gold, More summon slots

## crazy idea:
### one shot bosses, chance to cure curse, chance for blessings (like a 0.1% chance that you get a blessed item which stats are just boosted) 

# Items
## idea:
### HP, Mana, Spirit, Attack speed, Movespeed, Luck, DMG types, Element type?, Summon slots, More gold

## cursed stats:
### HP, Mana, Spirit, Attack speed, Movespeed, Luck, DMG types, Summon slots, Less gold

# Currency
