# project-Alpha

Just a personal project which I intend to work on whenever I feel like it. 

Intending to create a rogue-like of some kind with procedural generation and hopefully fun gameplay loop

Visual are intended to be pixel art.


## Theme: Medieval Europe

## Gameplay loop
### Dungeon Crawling? Procedural open world?
Maybe a mix of both? 
### Player Village?
function as player hub where upgrades can be purchased and spend skillpoints. *Further deliberation required*

##### Possibilty 1: Has built in slot system where it gets more slots with lvl/upgrades. It can then reanimate dead corpses for a cost of slots which will fight for him and are slightly stronger than enemy counterparts
